Here is my Django project and in this project I check logging user and only creator user is allowed to edit and update its data but everybody can see its data .It has a search on book name and description and also tags .Every book can have a picture and by clicking on picture it will show in full screen. Each user can read other users data and also add new data but no one can edit or delete others data. Everyone can have a favorite list of book by clicking on star near the name of book. Also it has a chat form that users can chat with each other. Its show chat message with its post time. In this program I use rest framework also and I use serialize for book and authors. I have also add session and cookie control for dieses library.
